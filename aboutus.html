      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        Baked Goods by Chef Nyosi, also referred to as SHISA Bakery is a bakery established in the year 2014 by its founder and Head Chef, Chef Nyosi, in Sterkspruit, Eastern Cape. 
        The company started because of the love that Chef Nyosi had toward baking and his desire of serving his people with high quality and freshly baked goods. 
        With a humble beginning, SHISA Bakery started as a small home kitchen where Chef Nyosi produced cupcakes, cakes and pastries for friends, families, and local customers. 
        The quality and exclusive taste of his products spread quickly by word of mouth and became the base for the gradual rise of the bakery. 
        SHISA Bakery is now an established local brand that has built a reputation for freshness, creativity, and community-focused service. 
        The company remains a constituent of good taste, a provider of delicious baked products, and a proud representative of local business culture in Sterkspruit.
